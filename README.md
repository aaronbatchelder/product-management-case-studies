## Overview
#### About PM Case Studies
This open-source repository exists to provide Product Managers and others interested, an aggregate resource for PM related case studies. The goal is to find and categorize case studies by topic. These topics include but are not limited to UI/UX, SDLC, PDLC, Post Mortems, and Startups. As PMs are constantly needing to test, benchmark, and ground decisions in as much substance as possible - case studies can be a quick and useful reference. Given the number of high quality case studies on varying topics scattered on the web, it's time they are brought together into one place.

#### How to Contribute
To stand a chance at being one of the best resources online for PM case studies we need a community of contributors. If you'd like to contribute studies found online or ones personally authored please see the following guidelines:

- Use the following format to list the resource `[Title](Link)`
- Provide a brief description (**300 char max**) of why you believe it should be added.
